# Anet A8 electronics enclosure

Enclosure for the Anet A8 electronics I am designing. Designed to be printed on the same printer and use the least additional hardware possible

## TODO

* add clips to the outside honeycomb enclosure for grabbing the frame of the printer
* try to save any space possible to make the honeycomb enclosure a little lower (faster to print)
