# Anet A8 electronics enclosure

Enclosure for the Anet A8 electronics I am designing. Designed to be printed on the same printer and use the least additional hardware possible

## TODO

* add clips to the outside honeycomb enclosure for grabbing the frame of the printer
* try to save any space possible to make the honeycomb enclosure a little lower (faster to print)
* think about cable management
* THINK ABOUT CABLE MANAGEMENT
* make clips for PCBs a little higher than PCB itself to produce better results when printing (account for tolerances and stuff)
* move clips for PCBs to suit accordingly. Try and make it as parametric as possible to be able to change the design easily
